          <p>Pets are any living animals which are regarded as man's 
            friend pet, any animal kept by human beings as a source of companionship and pleasure. 
            A pet, or companion animal, is an animal kept primarily for a person's company or entertainment rather than as a working animal, livestock, or a laboratory animal. Popular pets are often considered to have attractive appearances, intelligence, and relatable personalities, but some pets may be taken in on an altruistic basis (such as a stray animal) and accepted by the owner regardless of these characteristics.
           </p> 
           <p>Any Aniamal at all can be used as pet . But the most common ones are dogs
           
             Other animals commonly kept include rabbits; ferrets; pigs; rodents such as gerbils, hamsters, chinchillas, rats, mice, and guinea pigs; birds such as parrots, passerines, and fowls; reptiles such as turtles, lizards, snakes, and iguanas; aquatic pets such as fish, freshwater snails, and saltwater snails; amphibians such as frogs and salamanders; and arthropod pets such as tarantulas and hermit crabs. Small pets may be 
            grouped together as pocket pets, while the equine and bovine group include the largest companion animals.</p>
            <h3>Reasons or importance of having pet</h3>
